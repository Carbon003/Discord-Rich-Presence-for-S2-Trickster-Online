Features : Display status (login screen / in-game), character name, character job, character level, current map, plus a “general area” map image and a character job image. Please note that by default this was made for S2 game clients.
May Need to be reworked to work on your own Private Server Clients
You need to code an injector so the DLL is injected into the client, best way is to use a custom made game launcher


For your own use, you might want to rename the project / files to something other than PTRPC (Prifma Trickster Rich Presence Client)
